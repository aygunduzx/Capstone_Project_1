Springboard Data Science Track Capstone-1 Project

Can Air Accidents and Incidents Be Predicted?

Problem: Air accidents and incidents can cost lives and huge resources. Understanding the factors behind them based on the previous data we have can help authorities to take preventative measures in advance and save lives and valuable assets. Thus, this project will answer the question if we can create algorithms in order to predict before it happens or not based on the collection of data we have so far.

Data: The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.
